\chapter{Introduction}

\label{ch:Introduction}In principle almost all processes occuring
in the fields of molecular and atomic physics can be reduced to electromagnetic
interaction of elementary particles. However, for the purpose of this
chapter we limit our discussion only to large scale electrostatic
and magnetostatic fields, which are determined in the experiment by
applied potentials to the electrodes, currents in the electromagnets,
and spatial distribution of charged particles in case of plasmatic
experiments. Good understanding of electromagnetic fields is essential
