  abstract = {It has recently been shown [A. K. Belyaev and A. S. Tiukanov, Chem.
	Phys. Lett., 1999, 302, 65] that the electron detachment process
	occurring during the reactive or inelastic H-+H-2 encounter preferentially
	takes place from the first excited state of H-3(-). The present paper
	investigates the possibility of this process occurring at a relatively
	low collision energy (E-coll< 2.5 eV) by tunnelling through that
	first excited electronic state. We use a two-state coupled wavepacket
	approach restricted to the collinear geometry, where the detachment
	probability is accounted for by a negative imaginary potential. The
	calculation is carried out using both the adiabatic representation
	and a diabatic representation. It is shown that the tunnelling effects
	efficiently populate the electron detachment channel even in energy
	domains where the first excited H-3(-) state is energetically closed.}

  abstract = {Multichannel atomic spectra frequently exhibit such extraordinary
	visual complexity that they appear at first glance to be uninterpretable.
	The present review discusses how to unravel such spectra through
	the use of theoretical multichannel spectroscopy to extract the key
	dynamical implications. Moreover, this class of techniques permits
	a quantitative prediction or reproduction of experimental spectra
	for some of the more challenging atomic systems under investigation.
	It is shown that multichannel spectroscopy marries the techniques
	of multichannel quantum-defect theory to the eigenchannel R-matrix
	method (or related methods). It has long been appreciated that multichannel
	quantum-defect theory can successfully use a collision-theory framework
	to interpret enormously complicated Rydberg spectra. However, the
	capabilities of multichannel quantum-defect theory have increased
	dramatically during the past decade, through the development of nearly
	ab initio methods for the calculation of the short-range scattering
	parameters that control the interactions of closed and open channels.
	In this review, emphasis is given to the alkaline-earth atoms, for
	which many different observables have been successfully compared
	with experiment over broad ranges of energy and resolution. Applications
	of the method to describe the photoionization spectra of more complex
	open-shell atoms are also discussed.},

	probe is presented. The probe data have been obtained on FALP apparatus
	for electron (and ion) number densities ranging from 10(12) m(-3)
	to 10(16) m(-3), at electron temperatures equal to room temperature
	and also roughly ten times higher and at neutral pressures from 60
	Pa to 150 Pa. The number densities of electrons for all measured
	probe data have been deduced from the electron current to the probe
	at the space potential and also by means of OML method from the electron
	current measured for positive probe with respect to the space potential.
	In the paper it is shown that in the flowing afterglow plasma the
	values of the electron density determined according both methods
	are in a good agreement and it is possible to take them as the reference
	number density for comparison with apparent ion densities obtained
	from the ion current. The number densities obtained from the ion
	currents in the ion accelerating region (negative probe with respect
	to the space potential) according to different applicable probe theories
	have been compared with reference value. It is found that the best
	agreement between the number densities evaluated from the electron
	current and from the ion current gives the theory of ion collection
	by TICHY et al. {[}16], which takes into account the collisions of
	ions with neutrals in the space charge sheath around the probe provided
	that the conditions correspond to the OML regime.},

	numbers. Based on the selection rules, we construct correlation diagrams

	particular, we describe a possible fragmentation of the system into

  abstract = {THE H-3(+) ion is widely believed to play an important role in interstellar
	chemistry, by initiating the chains of reactions that lead to the
	production of many of the complex molecular species observed in the
	interstellar medium(1-5). The presence of H-3(+) in the interstellar
	medium was first suggested(6) in 1961, and its infrared spectrum
	was measured(7) in the laboratory in 1980. But attempts(8-11) to
	detect it in interstellar space have hitherto proved unsuccessful,
	Here we report the detection of H-3(+) absorption in the spectra
	of two molecular clouds. Ali-hough the present results do not permit
	an accurate determination of the H-3(+) abundances, these ions appear
	nevertheless to be present in sufficient quantities to drive much
	of the chemistry in molecular clouds, It should soon be possible
	to obtain more accurate measurements, and thus better quantify the
	role of ion-neutral reactions in the chemical evolution of molecular
	clouds.}

  abstract = {The molecular multichannel quantum defect theory, initially developed
	to describe the escape of an electron from the molecular core region,
	is extended to include dissociation of the molecule into two atoms.
	The mixing between the two types of channels results from electronic
	interaction between a Rydberg series and dissociative valence states
	of the neutral molecule. This interaction is introduced as an additional
	phaseshift into the continuum parts of the wavefunctions. The resulting
	unified treatment of (pre)ionisation and (pre)dissociation is applied
	to the process of dissociative recombination, following the approach
	of C.M. Lee (1973). The 'indirect' process proceeding via electron
	capture in vibrationally excited Rydberg states is taken into account
	fully by the inclusion of closed electron-ion channels in the calculation.
	Model calculations are presented and the influence of various physical
	parameters on the dissociative recombination profile is tested.}

	In this Letter, we present observations of strongly polar ion and
	neutral molecules such as SiO, H13CO+, HN13C, and H13CN, which reveal
	the electron density enhancements associated with the precursor of
	the young L1448-mm outflow. While in the ambient gas the excitation
	of the ions and neutrals is explained by collisional excitation by
	H2 with a single density of \~{}105 cm-3, H13CO+ shows an overexcitation
	in the shock precursor component that requires H2 densities a factor
	of [?]10 larger than those derived from the neutral species. This
	overexcitation in H13CO+ can be explained if we consider an additional
	excitation by collisions with electrons and an electron density enhancement
	in the precursor stage by a factor of \~{}500, i.e., a fractional
	ionization of 5 x 10-5. These results show that multiline observations
	can be used to study the evolution of the ion and electron fluids
	at the first stages of the C-type shock interaction.}

  abstract = {The article discusses the role of non-Born-Oppenheimer couplings in
	dissociative recombination (DR) of triatomic and diatomic molecular
	ions. For highly symmetric molecular ions the couplings play an important
	role, which results in a high rate for the indirect DR process. The
	non-Born-Oppenheimer couplings are particularly strong in highly-symmetric
	ions owing to the degeneracy of electronic and vibrational states
	at the equilibrium configuration of the nuclei. This is a generic
	property of polyatomic molecular ions, frequently associated with
	the Jahn-Teller or Renner-Teller effect, although analogous situations
	should occur in other species having conical intersections. In this
	respect, DR in triatomic ions differs significantly from DR in diatomic
	systems, where indirect DR is usually slow, although one exception
	to this rule is reviewed here. We concentrate here on the dissociative
	recombination of two highly symmetric triatomic ions: H+3 and HCO+.

  abstract = {The dissociative recombination of an H-3(+) ion after it is struck
	by a low-energy electron is important for understanding observations
	of H-3(+) in diffuse interstellar clouds. At the same time, it is
	the simplest triatomic ion and for this reason its theoretical description
	can serve as a prototype for other polyatomic ions. Meanwhile, experimental
	determinations of the recombination rate have varied widely, which
	has resulted in some controversy and confusion. Until recently, it
	seemed unlikely that this problem could be resolved by theoretical
	studies because the mechanism of H-3(+) dissociative recombination
	remained unclear. A recent study, however [Kokoouline , Nature (London)
	412, 891 (2001)], provided evidence that the inclusion of the Jahn-Teller
	coupling can produce a dissociative recombination rate that overlaps
	the range of experimental observations. Here, we propose a theoretical
	description of the coupling between nuclear and electronic degrees
	of freedom in a polyatomic molecule, which describes the competition
	between autoionization and predissociation of the Rydberg states
	formed after an incident electron is captured. The method treats
	the vibrational and rotational excitations of the ion, accounts for
	all symmetry restrictions imposed by the geometry of the molecule,
	including vibrational, rotational, and electronic and nuclear-spin
	symmetries. The framework combines the multichannel quantum-defect
	theory, the adiabatic hyperspherical approach, and the techniques
	of outgoing-wave Siegert pseudostates. The proposed method can be
	applied to studies of dissociative recombination of other triatomic
	ions, including all the degrees of freedom quantum mechanically.
	Our calculations of the cross section and the recombination rate
	confirm that the Jahn-Teller effect is responsible for the large
	rate in H-3(+). Theoretical results for dissociative recombination
	of H-3(+) are in agreement with storage-ring experiments.},

  abstract = {The vibrational relaxation of H-3(+) molecules from a conventional
	plasma ion source is studied performing Coulomb explosion imaging
	on the ions extracted from a storage ring after variable times of
	storage. Storage for 2 s is found sufficient for radiative relaxation
	of the breathing excitation and the fragment velocity distribution
	in the breathing coordinate then agrees well with simulations based
	on the calculated ground-state wave function. The radiative decay
	of the two lowest pure breathing levels (1,0(0)) and (2,0(0)) is
	seen to be considerably faster than expected from rotationless calculations.
	Assuming a high rotational excitation of the H-3(+) ions, as suggested
	already in earlier experiments, the theoretical transition probabilities
	of the University College London line list for H-3(+) [L. Neale,
	S. Miller, and J. Tennyson, Astrophys. J. 464, 516 (1996)] can explain
	the increase of the vibrational cooling rates and reproduce the observed
	decay curve for the lowest breathing-excited level, confirming the
	absolute transition probabilities of these line tables. The observations
	give evidence for a quasistable population of high-lying rotational
	levels in the stored ion beam, relevant for the interpretation of
	storage ring measurements on the rate coefficients for dissociative
	recombination of H-3(+) ions with low-energy electrons.},

	studies of the H-3(+) infrared spectrum, reporting 895 transition.,,
	from a variety of fundamental, overtone, combination, and hot bands,
	The results of these two decades of labor, however, are difficult
	to utilize. There is no comprehensive list of the observed H-3(+)
	transitions, and the literature contains errors in frequency measurement
	and assignment due to the inherent difficult of the measurements
	and the complexity of the spectrum. This paper resolves these problems
	while assembling all of the data into a single source. We have reviewed
	all reported transitions of H-3(+) for reliability in frequency measurement
	and have reassigned them based on a comparison with recent theoretical
	calculations. We have also developed a complete labeling scheme for
	all energy levels below 9000 cm(-1), which alleviates the confusion
	in assigning H-3(+) transitions that results from the difficulty
	of labeling the rovibrational energy levels of a molecule with such
	strong mixing. Our comprehensive linelist was then used to produce
	a set of 526 experimentally determined energy levels, which facilitates
	direct comparison with theoretical calculations and prediction of

  abstract = {This paper presents the first dissociative recombination (DR) measurement
	of electrons with rotationally and vibrationally cold H-3(+) ions.
	A dc discharge pinhole supersonic jet source was developed and characterized
	using infrared cavity ringdown spectroscopy before installation on
	the CRYRING ion storage ring for the DR measurements. Rotational
	state distributions (T(rot)similar to30 K) produced using the source
	were comparable to those in the diffuse interstellar medium. Our
	measurement of the electron energy dependence of the DR cross section
	showed resonances not clearly seen in experiments using rotationally
	hot ions, and allowed calculation of the thermal DR rate coefficient
	for ions at interstellar temperatures, alpha(DR)(23 K)=2.6x10(-7)
	cm(3) s(-1). This value is in general agreement with recent theoretical
	predictions by Kokoouline and Greene [Phys. Rev. A 68, 012703 (2003)].
	The branching fractions of the two breakup channels, H+H+H and H+H-2,
	have also been measured for rotationally and vibrationally cold H-3(+).},

  abstract = {The H-3(+) molecular ion plays a fundamental role in interstellar
	chemistry, as it initiates a network of chemical reactions that produce
	many molecules(1,2). In dense interstellar clouds, the H-3(+) abundance
	is understood using a simple chemical model, from which observations
	of H-3(+) yield valuable estimates of cloud path length, density
	and temperature(3,4). But observations of diffuse clouds have suggested
	that H-3(+) is considerably more abundant than expected from the
	chemical models(5-7). Models of diffuse clouds have, however, been
	hampered by the uncertain values of three key parameters: the rate
	of H-3(+) destruction by electrons (e(-)), the electron fraction,
	and the cosmic-ray ionization rate. Here we report a direct experimental
	measurement of the H-3(+) destruction rate under nearly interstellar
	conditions. We also report the observation of H-3(+) in a diffuse
	cloud ( towards zeta Persei) where the electron fraction is already
	known. From these, we find that the cosmic-ray ionization rate along
	this line of sight is 40 times faster than previously assumed. If
	such a high cosmic-ray flux is ubiquitous in diffuse clouds, the
	discrepancy between chemical models and the previous observations(5-7)
	of H-3(+) can be resolved.},

  abstract = {Context. The high degree of deuteration observed in some prestellar
	cores depends on the ortho-to-para H2 ratio through the H3+ fractionation.
	Aims. We want to constrain the ortho/para H2 ratio across the L183
	prestellar core. This is mandatory to correctly describe the deuter-
	ation ampli?cation phenomenon in depleted cores such as L183 and
	to relate the total (ortho+para) H2D+ abundance to the sole ortho-H2D+
	column density measurement. Methods. To constrain this ortho/para
	H2 ratio and derive its profile, we make use of the N2D+ /N2H+ ratio
	and of the ortho-H2D+ observations performed across the prestellar
	core. We use two simple chemical models limited to an almost totally
	depleted core description. New dissociative recombination and trihydrogen
	cation-dihydrogen reaction rates (including all isotopologues) are
	presented in this paper and included in our models. Results. We estimate
	the H2D+ ortho/para ratio in the L183 cloud, and constrain the H2
	ortho/para ratio : we show that it is varying across the prestellar
	core by at least an order of magnitude being still very high (~0.1)
	in most of the cloud. Our time-dependent model indicates that the
	prestellar core is presumably older than 1.5-2 x 10^5 years but that
	it may not be much older. We also show that it has reached its present
	density only recently and that its contraction from a uniform density
	cloud can be constrained. Conclusions. A proper understanding of
	deuteration chemistry cannot be attained without taking into account
	the whole ortho/para family of molecular hydrogen and trihydrogen
	cation isotopologues as their relations are of utmost importance
	in the global scheme. Tracing the ortho/para H2 ratio should also
	give useful constraints on the dynamical evolution of prestellar
	cores.},

	and a useful probe of temperature and ion densities. The H ion is
	predicted to form in the thermospheres of close-in ``hot Jupiters,''
	where its emission would be a significant factor in the thermal energy
	budget, affecting temperature and the rate of hydrogen escape from
	the exosphere. Hot Jupiters are predicted to have up to 105 times
	Jupiter's H emission because they experience extreme stellar irradiation
	and enhanced interactions may occur between the planetary magnetosphere
	and the stellar wind. Direct (but unresolved) detection of an extrasolar
	planet, or the establishment of useful upper limits, may be possible
	because a small but significant fraction of the total energy received
	by the planet is reradiated in a few narrow lines of H within which
	the flux from the star is limited. We present the observing strategy
	and results of our search for emission from the Q(1,0) transition
	of H (3.953 mm) from extrasolar planets orbiting six late-type dwarfs
	using CSHELL, the high-resolution echelle spectrograph on NASA's
	Infrared Telescope Facility. We exploited the time-dependent Doppler
	shift of the planet, which can be as large as 150 km s-1, by differencing
	spectra between nights, thereby removing the stellar photospheric
	signal and telluric lines. We set limits on the H emission from each
	of these systems and compare them with models in the literature.
	Ideal candidates for future searches are intrinsically faint stars,
	such as M dwarfs, at very close distances.}

	formation ratio of the 4p' state having an Ar+ (P-2(1/2)) ion core
	in the Ar+ (P-2(3/2))/2e(-) recombination indicated that such a two-electron
	process as an electron transfer to an inner 3p orbital followed by
	excitation of a 3p electron to an outer 4p orbital occurs significantly.
	The higher formation ratios of 4d + 5p + 5d + 6s + 6p + 6d than those
	of 4d' + 5p' + 5d' + 6s' led us to conclude the formation of these
	upper states dominantly proceeds through one electron transfer to
	an outer nl orbital of Ar+ (P-2(3/2)). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

	States of ArHe+ are tested as to their ability to describe swarm

	potentials based on spectroscopic measurements and model potentials
	chosen specifically so as to match the transport data. Ar+-ion velocity
	distributions in a drift tube containing a helium buffer are calculated
	from the potentials that best match the mobility data, by solution
	of the Boltzmann kinetic equation. The velocity distributions are
	used with estimated cross sections for the charge-transfer reaction
	Ar+ + N2 to calculate the effects upon the rate coefficients when
	the distribution differs from a Maxwell-Boltzmann form. The results
	indicate that the corrections are small at high buffer gas temperatures
	(293 K and above) and low to moderate electric-field strengths, but
	become larger at low temperature (82 K) and high fields. The smallness
	of the corrections confirms that previous rate coefficient measurements
	in a drift tube show a dependence of the Ar+ + N2 reaction upon the
	rotational temperature of N2.},

	differential cross sections in the CM system. Absolute units are
	obtained by using elastic H-+He scattering as a reference system.
	The measurements allow detailed conclusions concerning the reaction
	mechanism. By integrating over angles and summing over partial cross
	sections (for individual upsilon ' states of the HD product molecule),
	we determine the absolute total cross section of the reaction. The
	reaction has a threshold at Erel=0.42+or-0.12 eV. The cross section
	rises to a maximum of 2*10-16 cm2 at 1.5 eV and then rapidly decreases
	again. The present results resolve a discrepancy between two previous
	measurements bearing on the determination of the total cross section.}
