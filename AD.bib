  abstract = {Recently, we have proposed to use both positive and negative ions
	for thrust in an electromagnetic space propulsion system. This concept
	is called PEGASES for Plasma Propulsion with Electronegative GASES
	and has been patented by the Ecole Polytechnique in France in 2007.
	The basic idea is to create a stratified plasma with an electron
	free (ion-ion plasma) region at the periphery of a highly ionized
	plasma core such that both positive and negative ions can be extracted
	and accelerated to provide thrust. As the extracted beam is globally
	neutral there is no need for a downstream neutralizer. The recombination
	of positive and negative ions is very efficient and will result in
	a fast recombination downstream of the thruster and hence there is
	no creation of a plasma plume downstream. The first PEGASES prototype,
	designed in 2007, has recently been installed in a small vacuum chamber
	for preliminary tests in our laboratory and the first results have
	been presented in several conferences. This paper reviews important
	work that has been used in the process of designing the first PEGASES
	prototype.},

	Data have been obtained for different photon energies within approximately
	1 eV of the detachment threshold. With our recently developed method
	we have achieved a precision of better than 25\% on these absolute
	cross sections. The experiments have been carried out by means of
	photodetachment tomography of the mass-selected molecular anions
	in a multipole radio-frequency ion trap. The measured absolute cross
	sections are in accordance with the empirical scaling law of Millar
	et al. and have allowed us to determine its free parameters. These
	results are important for predicting the photostability and thus
	the abundance of carbon chain anions in planetary atmospheres, in
	circumstellar envelopes, and in photon-dominated regions of interstellar
	molecular clouds.},

	for the ITER neutral beam injection system. The RF source is now
	an interesting alternative to the reference design with filamented
	sources due to its in principle maintenance-free operation. Current
	densities of 330 A m -2 and 230 A m -2 have been achieved for hydrogen
	and deuterium, respectively, at a pressure of 0.3 Pa and an electron/ion
	ratio of 1 for a small extraction area (7.0 × 10 -3 m 2 ) and short
	pulses (<4 s). Reliable deuterium operation with more than 150 pulses
	in the required parameter range was obtained by an improved caesium
	operation utilizing a control of all source temperatures (grid as
	well as source body) and monitoring the amount of caesium in the
	source. The development now concentrates on extending the pulse length
	to up to 1 h and extending the size of the source. The long pulse
	test bed went into operation last year; pulses of up to some 100
	s with more or less stable conditions in terms of extracted currents
	and Cs dynamics have been achieved with current densities in the
	range of 150-200 A m -2 in hydrogen operation. The pulse length,
	however, is still limited by non-sufficient cooling of some parts
	of the source and the RF circuit. The commissioning of the so-called
	half-size source test facility started recently with the first plasma
	pulses; this large RF source with the width and half the height of
	the ITER NNBI source is dedicated to demonstrate the homogeneity
	of a large RF plasma-extraction is foreseen in a later phase-and
	the tests of an ITER-relevant RF circuit.},

	for understanding these ions and their interaction at low temperatures

	simple but efficient in situ characterization of their low-lying
	rotational states. In this contribution we report measurements of
	near infrared (NIR) absorption spectra. Required high sensitivity
	is achieved by combining liquid nitrogen cooled plasma with the technique
	of NIR cavity ringdown absorption spectroscopy. The measured transition
	frequencies are then used for exciting cold ions stored in a low-temperature
	22-pole radiofrequency ion trap. Absorption of a photon by the stored
	ion is detected by using the laser-induced reactions technique. As
	a monitor reaction, the endothermic proton (or deuteron) transfer
	to Ar is used in our studies. Since the formed ArH+ (or ArD+) ions
	are detected with near unit efficiency, the stored ions can be characterized
	very efficiently, even if there are just a few of them.},

	detachment of H- and H, thereby destroying the H-. The H- anion can
	also be destroyed by a number of other reactions, most notably by
	mutual neutralization with protons. However, neither the associative
	detachment nor the mutual neutralization rate coefficients are well
	determined: both may be uncertain by as much as an order of magnitude.
	This introduces a corresponding uncertainty into the H2 formation
	rate, which may have cosmological implications. Here we examine the
	effect that these uncertainties have on the formation of H2 and the
	cooling of protogalactic gas in a variety of situations. We show
	that the effect is particularly large for protogalaxies forming in
	previously ionized regions, affecting our predictions of whether
	or not a given protogalaxy can cool and condense within a Hubble
	time, and altering the strength of the ultraviolet background that
	is required to prevent collapse.},

	temperature diagram and an assumed source size of 30'', we find a
	total C 8 H column density of 8(3) Ã— 10 12 cm -2 and a rotational
	temperature of ~13 K. From the five detected transitions of C 8 H

	with a rotational temperature of ~34 K for a total C 8 H/C 8 H -
	column density ratio of ~3.8. This observed C 8 H/C 8 H - column
	density ratio is similar to the theoretical prediction of 3.6, while
	the observed column densities were lower than that predicted by a
	factor of ~30. This prompted us to reinvestigate the initial conditions
	of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) model. The new model results
	are presented, and they more closely match the C 8 H and C 8 H -
	abundances observed with the GBT. Finally, we use the new CSE model
	results to predict the abundance of decapentaynyl (C 10 H), and we
	compare them with the measured upper limit found from the GBT observations.},

	metal-free halos, where the first generation of stars (Population
	III stars) in the universe is formed. However, in the published literature,
	the rate coefficient for this reaction is uncertain by nearly an
	order of magnitude. We report on the results of both adaptive mesh
	refinement and smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of the
	collapse of metal-free halos as a function of the value of this rate
	coefficient. For each simulation method, we have simulated a single
	halo three times, using three different values of the rate coefficient.
	We find that while variation between halo realizations may be greater
	than that caused by the three-body rate coefficient being used, both
	the accretion physics onto Population III protostars as well as the
	long-term stability of the disk and any potential fragmentation may
	depend strongly on this rate coefficient.},

  abstract = {Titan's lower atmosphere has long been known to harbor organic aerosols
	(tholins) presumed to have been formed from simple molecules, such
	as methane and nitrogen (CH4 and N2). Up to now, it has been assumed
	that tholins were formed at altitudes of several hundred kilometers
	by processes as yet unobserved. Using measurements from a combination
	of mass/charge and energy/charge spectrometers on the Cassini spacecraft,
	we have obtained evidence for tholin formation at high altitudes
	(?1000 kilometers) in Titan's atmosphere. The observed chemical mix
	strongly implies a series of chemical reactions and physical processes
	that lead from simple molecules (CH4 and N2) to larger, more complex
	molecules (80 to 350 daltons) to negatively charged massive molecules
	(?8000 daltons), which we identify as tholins. That the process involves
	massive negatively charged molecules and aerosols is completely unexpected.},
